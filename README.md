# The_Legend_of_Big_Iron_Demo
A top-down dungeon crawler I made in 2 weeks.

Welcome everyone to The Legend of Big Iron! I made this game as a project for the final part of the C# instruction at MSSA. Some Key Notes from the game is that it uses procedurally generated dungeons, a savable inventory and health system, and a scalable trading system! Obviously this is limited in scope mostly because of the time frame it was made in as well as the fact that I had to use free publicly available art as I am not an artist. However, this is a great starting point and I have many ideas for where I want to take this game in the future.

I had always wanted to make a game in Unity but never finished one until now, hopefully this is the start of many more passion projects of mine!

Since the game doesn't have a tutorial I'll put a quick how to play here:

WASD for movement

Left-Click to attack

E to open your Inventory

F to interact

Escape to pause the game

You will start out in a market square, to the south are 2 vendors you can trade with, to the north there is an entrance to the dungeons. 

See what you can find and have fun!
